thekogans_crypto takes a task oriented approach to OpenSSL. if you're
familiar with the OpenSSL API, you're undoubtedly familiar with it's
complexity. this complexity comes as a result of it's granular design.
more often then not, we need to perform a particular cryptographic
task (encrypt a file, sign and verify a file, generate symmetric and
asymmetric keys...). OpenSSL's API makes it difficult to see the forest
for the trees.

thekogans_crypto exposes a collection of objects that perform high
level cryptographic tasks like the ones mentioned above.
